# Fish shell configuration
# Main configuration is modularized in conf.d/ directory
# Files in conf.d/ are automatically sourced in alphabetical order

# This file is intentionally minimal - most configuration lives in:
# - conf.d/01-paths.fish - PATH configuration
# - conf.d/02-theme.fish - Theme setup
# - conf.d/03-tools.fish - Tool initialization
# - conf.d/04-env-vars.fish - Environment variables
# - conf.d/05-completions.fish - Shell completions and aliases
